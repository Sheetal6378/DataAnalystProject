# DataAnalystProject
I developed a comprehensive project in PowerBi, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization

## Blinkit Sales Analysis - Power BI Dashboard



## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using various KPIs and visualizations in Power BI, we identify key insights and opportunities for optimization.

## Short Description
This Power BI project analyzes Blinkit's sales performance using key metrics like Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items Sold, and Average Rating. The dashboard includes various visualizations such as bar charts, donut charts, and funnel maps to assess trends in sales by fat content, item type, outlet size, and location. The insights help in identifying opportunities for business optimization and performance improvement.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard includes the following key metrics to evaluate performance:

The overall revenue generated from all items sold.

Total Sales - The overall revenue generated from all items sold.

Average Sales - The average revenue per sale.

Number of Items - The total count of different items sold.

Average Rating - The average customer rating for items sold.

## Dashboard Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard features multiple charts and graphs to present meaningful insights:

## 1. Total Sales by Fat Content

   Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.

   Additional KPI Metrics: Assess variations in Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating.

   Chart Type: Donut Chart.

## 2. Total Sales by Item Type

    Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.

    Additional KPI Metrics: Evaluate Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating.

    Chart Type: Bar Chart.

## 3. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales

   Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.

   Additional KPI Metrics: Examine variations in Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating.

   Chart Type: Stacked Column Chart.

## 4. Total Sales by Outlet Establishment

   Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.

   Chart Type: Line Chart.

## 5. Sales by Outlet Size

   Objective: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.

   Chart Type: Donut/Pie Chart.

## 6. Sales by Outlet Location

   Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.

   Chart Type: Funnel Map.

## 7. All Metrics by Outlet Type

   Objective: Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items) broken down by different outlet types.

   Chart Type: Matrix Card.

## Technologies Used
